  abstract  = {Experimental data indicates that poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers flatten when in contact
with a substrate, i.e. they are no longer spherical, but resemble flat disks. In order to better understand
the deformation behavior of these branched polymers, a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations
is performed. The resulting flattened dendrimer conformations are compared to atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images of individual dendrimers at air/mica and water/mica interfaces. The ability of the polymers
to deform is investigated as a function of dendrimer generation (2–5) and the required energies are
calculated. Our modeling results show good agreement with the experimental AFM images, namely that
dendrimers are highly flexible and capable of forming multiple interaction sites between most of their
branch ends and the substrate. The deformation energy scales with dendrimer generation and does not
indicate an increase in stiffness between generations 2 and 5 due to steric effects.},

  abstract  = {We consider passive inertial particles settling under the combined action of gravity and
a Stokes drag in two-dimensional velocity fields with increasing complexity. The average settling
speed is studied in simple steady and time-dependent cellular and in turbulent flows. Different
regimes are identified in relation to the physical properties and complexity of the fields. While
for steady and slowly varying weak cellular fields the settling velocity is a decreasing quadratic
function of the Eulerian velocity, the same behaviour does not occur for actual turbulent fields.
Large fluid velocities, on the other hand, generally speeds up the settling process. The relationships
between settling times and the properties of particle trajectories in the different regimes are
discussed.},

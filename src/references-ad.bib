  abstract  = {Designers spend much efforts in defining their products and systems, planning how they work during normal operation. Design assisting tools like Design Matrices in Axiomatic Design (AD) or Design Record Graphs (DRG) are available to the designer in search for ways to improve their work. Majority of accidents, however, take place during irregular operations like maintenance when interlocks are often bypassed and automatic processing are switched to manual. System safety is then in the hands of human operators. A number of past AD studies have addressed safety in products and systems, however, design parameters (DPs) have been physical parts or structures. This paper shows assignment of human actions, like, “reading the quantity display,” “making judgement,” or “pressing a control button,” as DPs in axiomatic design. Such human DPs play important roles during maintenance, nevertheless, designers often leave out safety evaluation of their designs in this maintenance mode. When a human DP fails to meet its functional requirement (FR), the product often faces failure and the system often heads into an accident. Identifying human DPs in products or systems thus alerts maintenance phase workers about actions that are critical for safety. Most accidents take place with excessive dependence on human DP of memory.},

  abstract  = {Automotive production is faced with the challenge of bringing new products to market faster, with decreasing turn-around times, meaning production must be continually changing to accommodate new products. This paper proposes an approach to decrease a product’s time-to-market, by increasing the efficiency of automotive assembly unit design. Providing designers with conceptual information about future vehicle models early in the product design process, could shift the design start forward and enable a more efficient transition process. Large automotive companies work on vehicle design and development for years before a product is ready for production. If during these earlier stages of product design, significant changes are identified and communicated to production designers, the manufacturing system design can get a jump start with an early exploration phase. A method exists, which uses the Axiomatic Design theory to develop Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems through a modular breakdown. A similar method {\textless}i{\textgreater}Adapt!{\textless}i/{\textgreater} employs Axiomatic Design and Scrum to develop changeable or adaptable production systems. This paper proposes to extend the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Adapt!{\textless}i/{\textgreater} method to include an exploration phase, which through early communication, provides an overview of the required design process, and enables faster identification of the critical design challenges. A case study is performed by analysing a currently produced vehicle and its future electric version.},

  abstract   = {The game of soccer has offered matter of wide scientific analysis about the effective application of the game theory in real-life. The field observations have often detected divergent behaviors from theoretical predictions. The basic problem comes from the fact that it is difficult to build scientific models reflecting reality as closely as possible. Axiomatic Design offers us a powerful tool of rational decomposition of a real and complex issue into elementary components. Independence Axiom guarantees that game decomposition will define a set of elementary actions logically consistent and free of redundancies. At the same time, Information Axiom can allow to select among alternative strategies, those that they predict the actions with a higher probability rate of success. In this paper, it is suggested the use of the Axiomatic Design methodology in the Collectively Exhaustive and Mutually Exclusive (CEME) mode, as a tool of analysis of the penalty shoot-out in extra time. This methodology allows to define the game strategies for goalkeepers and penalty takers. It will be analyzed both, the case when the opponents' behavior is well known and the situation when the statistics about the opponents are unknown. Axiomatic Design allows the process of decomposition to be simplified, enabling the selection of optimal game strategies. These strategies correspond to Nash’s equilibrium solutions when you already know about your opponents' game behavior. On the contrary, when penalty takers whose behavior is unknown, then it is always possible to define a strategy corresponding to the Bayesian equilibrium game solutions.},

  abstract  = {Type-2 Diabetes remains a progressive chronic disease that takes more and more lives every year. Small studies are beginning to show that a lifestyle approach could reverse type-2 diabetes in most individuals. The key discoveries from these studies are captured and formulated into a System Design Map for Prevention, Early Detection, and Reversal of Type-2 Diabetes using Collective System Design. Collective System Design describes systems as four aspects that interrelate: tone, thinking, structure and work. The tone in Collective System Design fosters an environment that views human failure as a failure of the system design itself. The thinking in Collective System Design is communicated by Axiomatic Design (AD).With the Collective System Design Approach, a model for prevention, early detection, and reversal of chronic disease is developed. The motivation for this paper is the ability to save millions of lives through a sustainable lifestyle program by identifying the required diet and exercise.},

First, an existing piece of curriculum is analyzed by axiomatic design approach and design matrices are made to check whether the independence axiom is satisfied or not. Second, functional requirements (FRs) are derived from the FRs of the existing curriculums developed through conventional methods. Constraints (Cs) are defined considering the time and subject. Design parameters (DPs) are conceived in physical domain to satisfy these specified FRs and Cs, and two alternative DPs for one FR are proposed. One of these alternatives having the least information content is selected by defining FRs as the minimization of the irrelevant subjects/topics and time. Also feasibility is estimated by comparing the information content of the redesigned curriculum with that of other curriculums in consideration of costs-involved, time, and subjects-relevance.},

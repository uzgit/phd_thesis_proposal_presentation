  abstract  = {Wind turbine farms are an effective generator of electricity in windy
	parts of the world, with prices progressing to levels competitive
	with other sources. Choosing the correct turbine for a given installation
	requires significant engineering and the current trend leads towards
	groups of large horizontal axis turbines. Unfortunately, large wind
	turbines have to contend with large forces and other sources of failure.
	With the new push to move generation farms offshore where they are
	less accessible, the issue of reliability becomes more critical.
	This work investigates the impact of reliability in a life-cycle
	analysis simulation of a theoretical wind farm in Massachusetts based
	upon reliability information from a number of academic sources. The
	simulator, TurbSim, is designed with significant modularity to enable
	reliability simulation of any turbine with available wind information.
	Our simulation of a turbine indicated that reliability makes a small
	but noticeable impact of 1.24\% in its output.},
